# Performance & Accessibility Audit Report

## Lighthouse Scores

- **Performance:** 54/100 ⚠️ (Needs Improvement)
- **Accessibility:** 88/100 ✅ (Good)
- **Best Practices:** 96/100 ✅ (Excellent)
- **SEO:** 100/100 ✅ (Perfect)

## Critical Performance Issues

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 11.1s ❌
**Target:** < 2.5s  
**Impact:** Major user experience issue - page appears to load very slowly  
**Cause:** Server response time issues in development mode

### 2. Total Blocking Time (TBT): 840ms ❌
**Target:** < 200ms  
**Impact:** Page is unresponsive during loading

### 3. Time to Interactive (TTI): 11.3s ❌
**Target:** < 3.8s  
**Impact:** Users cannot interact with the page quickly

### 4. Server Response Time: 1,890ms ❌
**Target:** < 600ms  
**Cause:** Development server overhead

## Accessibility Issues

### 1. Button Accessibility ❌
- Some buttons lack accessible names
- Affects screen reader users

### 2. Color Contrast ❌
- Some text/background combinations don't meet WCAG standards
- Specific areas need contrast ratio improvements

### 3. Heading Order ❌
- Heading elements not in sequential order
- Affects document structure and navigation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Before Deployment)

1. **Accessibility Fixes**
   - Add aria-labels to all interactive buttons
   - Fix color contrast issues (increase contrast ratios)
   - Correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

2. **Performance Quick Wins**
   - Enable production mode for accurate metrics
   - Implement code splitting for JavaScript bundles
   - Add loading="lazy" to images below the fold

### Production Optimization

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify for CDN and edge caching
   - Enable compression (gzip/brotli)
   - Set proper cache headers for static assets

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Convert images to WebP format
   - Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
   - Implement responsive images with srcset

3. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Remove unused JavaScript (detected in audit)
   - Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Minimize bundle size with tree shaking

## Note on Development vs Production

**Important:** Current metrics are from development server which has:
- Hot module replacement overhead
- No optimizations enabled
- Debug mode active
- Source maps included

**Expected Production Improvements:**
- LCP: Should drop to ~2-3s
- TBT: Should drop to ~100-200ms
- TTI: Should drop to ~3-4s

## Next Steps

1. Fix critical accessibility issues (buttons, contrast, headings)
2. Deploy to production environment
3. Re-run Lighthouse on production URL
4. Fine-tune based on production metrics

## Success Criteria

- All Lighthouse scores > 90 in production
- LCP < 2.5s
- Mobile-first performance verified
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved
